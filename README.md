# Warm-Up Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to serve as a **warm-up exercise** for us to collaborate and work effectively as a team. It is designed to introduce a structured workflow and showcase the integration of a backend and frontend in a Java web application.

## Overview

This project is a **Java Web Application** with the following components:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot-based for managing hierarchical data structures.
- **Frontend**: HTML and JavaScript for displaying the data.

## Goals

The key focus of the project is to:

1. **Showcase Hierarchical Data Management**:
    - Maintain a hierarchical data structure on the backend.
    - Display the hierarchy on the frontend.

2. **Enable Parallel Development**:
    - A simple `jstree.html` file has been developed using mock data to:
        - Present the tree structure and table view of the data.
        - Facilitate frontend and backend development with limited dependencies.

## Actions

To run the backend REST application, locate the main method in ChallengeApplication class
to run it in your IDE. By default the application listens on port 8080. And you can access
the REST endpoint at http://localhost:8080/nodes/1-1.

By working on this project, we aim to establish a collaborative environment and build familiarity with tools, frameworks, and team workflows.
